# RentMe Cross-Platform Mobile Application

RentMe is a solution that will enable individuals/users to rent an item for a given fee as would be required by the item owner. Payment can either be paid through card transfers using Flutterwave or airtime using Reloadly depending on the accepted payment option of the owner of the item.
